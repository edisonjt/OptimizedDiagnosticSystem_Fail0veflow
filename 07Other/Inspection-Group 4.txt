Execution Proyect

2. At the time of saving the data it gave us a confirmation message, which we put it that if we want to save or not save, it saves the data.
3. The data types are not validated, because at the time of entering a data there is no error message regarding the type of data entered
4. The data added in the doctor and Nurse is saved in the same line of the csv file
5. In the medical history menu, you must enter the user who registered in the registration menu, but if any other user is entered, the program continues running without showing an error message saying that said user is not registered.
6. When the option appears, you want to add more doctors. Press option 1 to add and 0 to continue. When another number is crushed the program does nothing, a message should appear saying that you only have to enter the required numbers.
